Change points can be defined as unexpected significant changes occurring in data. Change point detection methods aim to identify these points using statistical techniques. Change point analysis is utilized in various fields such as finance, quality control, and network analysis. In this study, change point detection methods were examined. AMOC, BinSeg, Segmented Regression, PELT, and Prophet algorithms were used within the scope of the study. To determine the performance of the algorithms in application, twenty artificial and eleven real datasets were employed. Performance was evaluated using the F1 score and cover metric. According to the F1 score, the most successful results were obtained with BinSeg on artificial data and with Segmented Regression on real data. Regarding the cover metric, BinSeg and Segmented  Regression yielded the best results on artificial data, while Segmented Regression performed the best on real data. To generate artificial data containing change points and apply the mentioned algorithms, an R Shiny web application was developed. Both R and Python programming languages were used in the study.\
